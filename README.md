**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in personalized financial plans. They approached Global Rain, my company, seeking a modernization of their operations and an upgrade to their software security. Their web-based application handles crucial financial data, necessitating robust protection against external threats. When identifying the security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's software, our team's comprehensive approach stood out. We combined manual inspection and automated tools to uncover various vulnerabilities, ensuring a thorough examination.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

Something in particular, that I think I did well for this project was suppressing any false negative vulnerabilities. Coding securely is essential because it safeguards against potential breaches, data theft, and system compromise. By implementing robust security measures, companies uphold the integrity of their systems, protect sensitive information, and maintain trust with their clients.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

Something I found to be quite challenging was verifying secure communication. I was able to successfully implement my cryptographic hash algorithm to provide me with a checksum verification, however, I was not able to demonstrate a secure webpage.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

To increase layers of security I implemented strong authentication protocols, encryption for sensitive data, and regular security patches and updates. For future assessments, I'd utilize a combination of automated tools, threat modeling, and continuous monitoring to assess vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation techniques.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

Something I found to be particularly helpful was the dependency check report homepage. There was a lot of useful information regarding how to read the report and what to look for. It was especially helpful when creating a suppression XML file.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

In showcasing my skills and expertise to future employers from this assignment, I would present a collection of artifacts that underline my proficiency in secure software development including recommendations of encryption algorithm ciphers, generation of CER files, deploying cipher and checksum verification, refactorization of codes without errors, and identifying and suppressing false negatives.
